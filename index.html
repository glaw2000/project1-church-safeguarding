                    Safeguarding aims to protect a person’s health, wellbeing and human rights; enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect. Those most in need of protection include children, young people and vulnerable adults. 
                    The Benifice of Warton and Borwick with Yealand is committed to safeguarding children, young people and adults from harm. 
                    The care and protection of children, young people and adults involved in Church activities is the responsibility of everyone who participates in the life of the Church.
