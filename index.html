                            Safeguarding aims to protect a person’s health, wellbeing and human rights; enabling them to live
                            free from harm, abuse and neglect. Those most in need of protection include children, young people
                            and vulnerable adults.
                            The Benifice of Warton and Borwick with Yealand is committed to safeguarding children, young people
                            and adults from harm.
                            The care and protection of children, young people and adults involved in Church activities is the
                            responsibility of everyone who participates in the life of the Church.
